# Working on Lamp

Lamp is a Mac app that builds other Mac apps with an LLM agent. Read `README.md` for what it is and
`RELEASING.md` for how it ships. This file is for whoever (or whatever) edits the code.

## Keep the agent harnesses in step

Lamp drives three coding agents, chosen in Settings → Building: **pi** (bundled), **Claude Code** and
**Codex**. They are set up in `Sources/Lamp/Engines.swift` (`Agent.run`), one `case` per engine, and
the output of each is read by its own parser there (`parseClaude`, `parseCodex`, and pi's in
`Agent.parseLine`).

A capability given to one engine must be given to all of them that can take it, in the same change:

- **Tools the agent calls** (`look_at_app`, `use_app`, `plan`, `delete_file`, the version tools): their
  names, descriptions and schemas live once, in `Resources/lamp-tools.json`. pi's extension
  (`Resources/lamp-tools.ts`) reads it for its definitions and holds only the `execute` bodies; Lamp's MCP
  endpoint (`Store.mcpTools`, `/mcp` on the gateway) serves it to Claude Code and Codex. A new tool is an
  entry there, an `execute` in the extension, and a `case` in `Store.mcp`.
  Codex has no file tools of its own, so the endpoint also gives it `read`, `ls`, `find` and `grep`
  (`FileTools`, listed when the URL carries `files=1`): they mirror pi's built-in ones, and each call is
  checked by `Privacy.verdict` like pi's. Don't let a Codex shell command skip approval because it looks
  like a read.
- **Rules in the system prompt** (`Agent.systemPrompt`, `Agent.tryRules`): every tool is available to every
  engine (`look_at_app`, `use_app`, `plan`, `delete_file` and the version tools), so their rules all live in
  `tryRules`. The file tools only Codex is given have theirs in `Agent.codexNote`.
- **Approvals and privacy**: shell commands go through `/agent/approve` for every engine (pi's extension,
  Claude Code's hooks, Codex's hooks); file access outside the app's folder is checked the same way.
- **What Lamp shows the user** (`BuildCard.activity`, `ToolCall`): tool names must be recognised in every
  engine's spelling. Claude Code calls MCP tools `mcp__lamp__<name>`; `Engines.plainName` strips that.
  Codex reports them as `mcp_tool_call` items.
- **Models**: each engine has its own model list and picker (`Builder.engineModel`); never default to Haiku.

Before opening a PR that touches any of this, check each engine's `case` in `Agent.run` and its parser,
and say in the PR description which engines you tried.

## Two Lamps on one Mac

A build from source is **Lamp Dev**, a separate app from the Lamp people install: its own name and icon (an
orange DEV banner), bundle id (`dev.lamp.host.dev`), folders (`~/Library/Application Support/Lamp Dev`,
`~/Applications/Lamp Dev Apps`, `~/Library/Logs/Lamp Dev`), gateway and model-server ports, URL scheme
(`lamp-dev://`) and Keychain entries, and no self-updating. `Sources/Lamp/Edition.swift` is the one place
these come from, read off the bundle id that `build.sh` writes (`FLAVOR=dev` by default; `release.sh` passes
`FLAVOR=release`). Anything new that names Lamp on disk or on the network goes through `Edition`, and the
generated apps get it through the `{{SCHEME}}`, `{{NOTE}}`, `{{HOST}}` and `{{APPS}}` placeholders in
`Template.swift`. The app-signing keychain is shared on purpose, so apps keep their permissions whichever
Lamp rebuilds them. `scripts/dev-data.sh` copies your apps, keys, settings and the agent's sign-ins from the
installed Lamp into Lamp Dev, so the development build has something to work on.

## Generated apps

`Sources/Lamp/Template.swift` holds `LampSupport.swift`, the support code copied into every generated
app (`LampAI`, `LampStore`, `LampScript`, the connectors, `LampDriver` for `use_app`). It is a Swift
string: after editing it, extract and type-check it (`swiftc -typecheck`), and bump anything that detects
an outdated app (`Store.open` rebuilds apps built by an older Lamp).

## Naming: Lamp and Lamp

The app is called **Lamp**: that's the name in everything the user reads (the interface, Help, the agent's
words to the user, the "Edit with Lamp" command in generated apps, the bundle and the DMG). **Lamp** is its
code name and stays in code, comments, type names (`LampSupport`, `LampAI`, …) and in everything existing
installs depend on: the bundle ID `dev.lamp.host`, `~/Library/Application Support/Lamp`,
`~/Applications/Lamp Apps`, the `lamp://` scheme, the `.lampapp` extension and the signing certificates.
Renaming any of those needs a migration, not a find-and-replace.

## Conventions

- Comments explain why, in plain prose; user-facing text never names files, types or frameworks.
- Verify in an isolated harness app rather than in the user's apps.
- No attribution lines in commits or PR descriptions.
